A list of questions I ask when interviewing at software companies. The goal is
to prevent myself from ending up in a place with low engineering standards and
toxic culture.

# Questions

1. How does an engineer in the top 3% look like for you?
2. What's your vision about the engineering organization?
3. Do you have any strong opinions about architecture and best practices? What
  are they?
4. How do you make sure teams understand the business problems they should
  solve?
5. How do engineers collaborate?
6. What's your software delivery philosophy and method?
7. What's your management philosophy?
8. How do you handle incidents and crises?
9. What roles do you have in a team? How do you prevent silos?
10. How do you balance code quality and feature delivery?
11. Are you doing estimates? Why?

Contributions are welcome! The better questions there are, the higher chance a
person won't end up in a bad company :)

However, keep in mind that things might be a bit subjective.
